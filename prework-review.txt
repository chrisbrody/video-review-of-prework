#PREWORK_REVIEW 1.1 - Intro to prework review
Hey Chris from Codify Academy here, I want to do a quick review of what we've done so far.

#PREWORK_REVIEW 1.2 - Set up your coding environment on your computer installed - chrome, atom, git.
We started by setting up our coding environment - we download Google Chrome for a web browser, Atom the text editor, Git for version control and we signed up for GitHub.

#PREWORK_REVIEW 1.3 - Built folder for all coding projects and a template for new coding projects
Once we had the tools to code, we created files and folder structure for the course and we created a template folder that we're going to use for new projects

#PREWORK_REVIEW 1.4 - HTML and CSS concepts to remember
We then saw some HTML and CSS concept and built a basic website called codefun1

Some Things to remember for HTML
we create elements aka tags in a .html file which are used to display words and images on a webpage
Each element usually has a start tag and a end tag
Some elements only have a start tag and are known as void tags.
Attributes are added to the start tag of an element
and are always set equal to quotes and then have a value inside the quotes.
Here are a few examples of some elements with attributes.

Some Things to remember for CSS
selectors are added in a .css file to choose HTML elements from a .html file so we can style them
we follow selectors with curly brackets
There are many different CSS selectors
so far we've selected html elements by tag name,
we've selected by class, we use a period followed by the value of a class attribute,
we've selected by id, we use a hash followed by the value of a id attribute,
and we saw how to use multiple selectors at once.

Once we have some HTML selected we can add property and value pairs to change how those element or elements look.
and there is no limit to the amount of properties added to a selector.


#PREWORK_REVIEW 1.5 - completed codecademy
Next you should have completed the codecademy Learn HTML and CSS Part 1 interactive lessons, and read the external readings.

#PREWORK_REVIEW 1.6 - Logo website replica -
Hopefully after codecademy you followed along with the video to build the logo website replication.

#PREWORK_REVIEW 1.7 - uploaded 3 projects to GitHub that we built together.
And then pushed the 3 projects we built together template, Codefun1 and Logo to GitHub using Git

#PREWORK_REVIEW 1.8 - Go back if anything was unfamiliar
And if you didn't do one or more of these, thats ok, check out the video description for links to what you need.

#PREWORK_REVIEW 1.9 - Otherwise hopefully familiar with these concepts, you built and loaded your projects to GitHub. that means we can move on to the next video and learn some more.
